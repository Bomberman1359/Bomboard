# Design Journal
Total Number of Hours Spent: 25 Hours

## Fresh Start: 6/20/2025, 4 Hours
I started off the basic design using the [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) to obtain raw data for the schematics.

These are the final results. The schematics took some time to figure out, but the actual wiring was just busy work. I also decided to add a knob for extra complexity and to make it seem more cooler. 

## PCB: 6/22/2025 - 6/24/2025, 11 Hours
As I uploaded my schematics to generate the PCB, my first step was to create the outline for the board. I had to make sure there was enough space for any wiring, rotary encoder, the usb port, and the knob. 
I also had to shift all the diodes in a way that would make the wiring simpler for me. 
The routing was the most tedious and complicated part. I had to constantly make changes to my previous wires due to the fact that I had to efficiently make use of the little space I had as much as possible.

Here is the final product (I forgot to take pictures of the process):

## CAD: 6/25/2025 - 6/28/2025, 10 Hours
I first started off with the plate of the keyboard using dimension tools:

Based off the plate, I created the bottom and the top part of the keyboard case respectively using various onshape features:

I decided to add a simple, geometric B at the remaining space I had on the top of my case for customization purposes.

This is the final, combined picture of the case:
