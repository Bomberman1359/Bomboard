# Bomboard
This is my cheap, custom keyboard made by me. As my first project, I named it Bomboard.

I made this project not only for the Highway programs, but also to gain experience in creating my own electronics.
I wanted to learn more about schematics, wiring, PCB, and 3D modeling. As someone that does not spend money on buying keyboards I figured it would be cool to create my own!
